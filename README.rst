## MCDWT and video scalabilty
**MCDWT inputs a [video][video] and outputs a video**, in a way that when using only a portion of the data of the transformed video, a video with a lower temporal resolution ([temporal scalability][Scalability]), lower spatial resolution ([spatial scalability][Scalability]) or/and lower quality ([quality scalability][Scalability]) can be generated. If all the transformed data is used, then the original video is obtained (MCDWT es is a lossless transform). The video output has exactly the same number of elements than the input video (for example, no extra motion fields are produced). At this moment, we will focuse only on spatial scalability.

## Video transform choices
To obtain a multiresolution version or a video, the<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> [DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)][DWT] can be applied along temporal (`t`) and spatial domains (`2D`). At this point, two alternatives arise: (1) a `t+2D` transform or (2) a `2D+t` transform. In a `t+2D` transform, the video is first analyzed over the time domain and next, over the spatial domain. A `2D+t` transform does just the opposite.

[DWT]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform

Each choice has a number of pros and cons. For example, in a `t+2D` transform we can apply directly any image predictor based on motion estimation because the input is a normal video. However, if we implement a `2D+t` transform, the input to the motion estimator is a sequence of images in the DWT domain. [The overwhelming majority of DWT's are not shift invariant][Friendly Guide], which basically means that DWT(`s(t)`) `!=` DWT(`s(t+x)`), where `x` is a displacement of the signal `s(t)` throughout the time domain. Therefore, motion estimators which compare pixel values will not work properly on the DWT domain. On the other hand, if we want to provide true spatial scalability (processing only those spatial resolutions (scales) necessary to get a spatially scaled of our video), a `t+2D` transformed video is not suitable because the first step of the forward transform (`t`) should be reversed at full resolution in the backward transform (as the forward transform did).

## Wavelet and pyramid domains
Indeed, the DWT allows to get a scalable representation of a image and by extension, of a video if we apply the DWT on all the images of the video. However, this can be also done with [Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids][Laplacian Pyramids]. Image pyramids are interesting because they are shift invariant and therefore, one can operate within the scales as they are *normal* images. Unfortunately, as a consecuence of pyramids representations are not critically sampled, they need more picture elements than in [Wavelet pyramids](Wavelet Pyramids) and this is a drawback when compressing. Luckily, it is very fast to convert a Laplacian pyramid representation into it DWT equivalent representation, and viceversa. For this reason, even if we use the Wavelet pyramids to work with our images, we can suppose at any moment that we are working with the Laplacian pyramid of those images.

## The 's'-levels 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform
A<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> [2D-DWT][2D-DWT] (2 Dimensions - Discrete Wavelet Transform) generates a scalable representation of an image and by extension, of a video if we apply the DWT on all the images of the video. This is done, for example, in [the JPEG2000 image and video compression standard][J2K]. Notice that only the spatial redundancy is exploited. All the temporal redundancy is still in the video.

### Input
A sequence `V` of `n` images:
```
                                                         x
+---------------+  +---------------+     +---------------+
|               |  |               |     |            |  |
|               |  |               |   y |----------- O <---- V[n-1][y][x]
|               |  |               | ... |               |
|               |  |               |     |               |
|               |  |               |     |               |
|               |  |               |     |               |
+---------------+  +---------------+     +---------------+
      V[0]               V[1]                 V[n-1]
```

### Output
A sequence `S` of `n` "pyramids". For example, a 2-levels 2D-DWT looks like:
```
+---+---+-------+  +---+---+-------+     +---+---+-------+
|LL2|HL2|       |  |   |   |       |     |   |   |       |
+---+---+  HL1  |  +---+---+       |     +---+---+       |
|LH2|HH2|       |  |   |   |       |     |   |   |       |
+---+---+-------+  +---+---+-------+ ... +---+---+-------+
|       |       |  |       |       |     |       |       |
|  LH1  |  HH1  |  |       |       |     |       |       |
|       |       |  |       |       |     |       |       |        
+-------+-------+  +-------+-------+     +-------+-------+       S[0]               S[1]                  S[2]
```
where `L` and `H` stands for *low-pass filtered* and *high-pass filtered*, respectively. The integer > 1 that follows these letters represents the subband level. For the sake of simplicity, we will denote the subbands `{LH, HL, HH}` as only `H`, and `LL` as only `L`. 

### Algorithm
```pytho
for image in V:
  2D_DWT(image) # In place
S = V # Pointer copy
```

### Scalability
The 2D-DWT applied to a video produces a representation scalable in the space (we can extract different videos with different spatial scales or resolutions), in the time (we can extract diferent videos with different number of frames) and in quality (we can get the DWT coefficients with different quantization steps to reconstruct videos of different quality).

### Inverse 's'-levels inverse 2D-DWT
In the last example, subbands `V2={S[0].LL2, S[1].LL2, ..., S[n-1].LL2}` represent the scale (number) 2 of the original video (the spatial resolution of this `V2` is the resolution of `V` divided by 4 in each spatial dimension).

To reconstruct the scale 1, we apply the 2D_iDWT (1-level 2D inverse DWT) in place (this means that the output of the transform replaces all or a part of the input data):
```python
for pyramid in S:
  2D_iDWT(pyramid) # In place
V = S # Pointer copy
```

And finally, to get the original video, we need to apply again the previous code over `S = V`.

### Implementation of 2D_DWT and 2D_iDWT
See for example, [pywt.wavedec2()](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/2d-dwt-and-idwt.html#d-multilevel-decomposition-using-wavedec2) at [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Redundancy and compression
The 2D-DWT provides an interesting feature to `S`: usually, `H` subbands has a lower entropy than `V`. This means that if we apply to `S` an entropy encoder, we can get a shorter representation of the video than if we encode `V` directly. This is a consequence of 2D-DWT exploits the spatial redudancy of the images of the video (neighboring pixels tend to have similar values and when they are substracted, they tend to produce zeros).

## Why MCDWT?
As we have said, the 2D-DWT does not exploit the temporal redundancy of a video. This means that we can achieve higher compression ratios if (in addition to the 2D-DWT) we apply a 1D-DWT along the temporal domain. This is exactly what MCDWT does. However, due to the temporal redundancy is generated mainly by the presence of objects in the scene of the video which are moving with respect to the camera, some sort of motion estimation and compensation should be used.

### MCDWT input
A sequence `V` of `n` images.

### MCDWT output
A sequence `T` of `n` (Wavelet) pyramids, organized in `l` temporal subbands, where each subband is a sequence of pyramids. The number of input and output pyramids is the same.

For example, if `l=2` and `n=5`:

```
